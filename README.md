This project is an exploration of how one can work with browserify and enjoy the 
loving warmth and care of amazing and popular libraries like bootstrap,semantic-ui  
and any other libraries which expect certain other libraries which finally have a 
proper browserify version(cough jQuery, cough) to be available on the global scope.
I used the browserify-shim module to shim these modules and use them in my code.
